Based on the length, this hash could have been generated by one of the following hashing functions:
MD5
MD4
MD2
HAVAL-128
RIPEMD-128
Snefru
Tiger-128

## The Salty Password
$2a$04$R3woFi8JQxib7WYkzCeLFeSk2Kbuq3qcddLKGZi4te1TluMX2y/cm

Your hash started with `$2a$04$...` which is the signature for bcrypt:

- `$2a$` = bcrypt variant
- `04` = cost factor
- The rest = salt + hash
- 

1. Create the txt filwe for hashcat to use: 
	command: 
		`echo '$2a$04$R3woFi8JQxib7WYkzCeLFeSk2Kbuq3qcddLKGZi4te1TluMX2y/cm' > hash.txt`
2. Install rockyou wordlist:
	command: 
		`cd ~
		`wget https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt`
3. Run hashcat: 
	Command:
		`hashcat -m 3200 -a 0 hash.txt ~/rockyou.txt`
4. View cracked hash
	Command: 
		`hashcat -m 3200 hash.txt --show`

## Running the Hashcat Code Explained:

`hashcat -m 3200 -a 0 hash.txt ~/rockyou.txt`
 **`hashcat`**
The hash cracking program itself
 **`-m 3200`**
- `-m` = Mode flag (hash type)
- `3200` = bcrypt algorithm
- Tells hashcat: "You're cracking a bcrypt hash"
 **`-a 0`**
- `-a` = Attack mode flag
- `0` = **Straight/Dictionary attack**
- This means: try every word in the wordlist as-is, one by one
**Other attack modes:**
- `-a 0` = Dictionary (straight)
- `-a 1` = Combination (combine words from two lists)
- `-a 3` = Brute-force/Mask (try all character combinations)
- `-a 6` = Hybrid wordlist + mask
- `-a 7` = Hybrid mask + wordlist
 **`hash.txt`**
- Your input file containing the hash to crack
- In your case: `$2a$04$R3woFi8JQxib7WYkzCeLFeSk2Kbuq3qcddLKGZi4te1TluMX2y/cm`
- Can contain multiple hashes (one per line)
**`~/rockyou.txt`**
- `~` = Your home directory (`/home/cryptkeeper/`)
- `rockyou.txt` = The wordlist file
- Contains ~14 million common passwords
- Hashcat tries each password from this list against your hash
## What happens when you run it:
1. Hashcat reads the bcrypt hash from `hash.txt`
2. Opens `rockyou.txt` wordlist
3. Takes first password ("123456")
4. Hashes it using bcrypt with the same salt
5. Compares result to your target hash
6. If no match, moves to next password ("password")
7. Repeats until match found or wordlist exhausted
